## Motivations

DeFi enables finance without middlemen and it is already a big financial market with $70 billion TVL. But, the current DeFi focuses on asset portfolios, where people can manage and increase their assets, not so many real use cases yet.

We believe next billions people come to the crypto space for an income opportunity, which is more familiar for them, compared to asset management. But right now, if they receive a salary with crypto, they have challenges borrowing money in both DeFi and TradFi.

・Major lending protocols are still overcollateralized with the need of 125% collateral

・Existing undercollateralized lending protocols are mainly for institutions

・They don’t like or don’t have a credit on TradFi

## Solution

Loanyee is uncollateralized lending against your on-chain salary.

If they receive the salary with Superfluid cash stream, they can borrow instant and uncollateralized loans by splitting some portion of their future salary to lenders. Our goal is to empower people and help their daily life by giving them the access to uncollateralized loans and providing instant funds. For lenders, they can also enjoy higher APY than overcollateralized lending protocol up to 30%.
